    " The poem centres on humanity and human nature . When the poet sees the figures , he wants to know their names and laments his ignorance . Eventually , he realizes that they are representative of Love , Ambition , and Poetry . While he longs , he fears they are out of reach and therefore tries to reject them . He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what \" love \" actually means ( \" What is Love ? and where is it ? \" ) . He rejects ambition , but it requires more work ( \" And for that poor Ambition \u2014 it springs / From a man 's little heart 's short fever @-@ fit ; \" ) . Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition , the narrator is unable to find a reason to <unk> Poesy ( Poetry ) , which reflects the poets ' inner conflict : should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living ?

Further , he was incapable of completing his epic , \" Hyperion \" . As Walter Jackson Bate explains , to Keats \" Neither a finished ' grand Poem ' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer . \" \n",
